Description: Create F-Droid repositories with ease
 F-Droid.org is just a repo out of hundreds of repos created by
 individuals all around the globe. With the tools of F-Droid, everyone
 can create their own repo. So whether you are a musician who wants to
 publish their music or a developer who wants to serve nightly builds
 of their app, you are free to create your own repo and share it with
 other people independently of F-Droid.org.
 .
 In the past, creating a repo has been difficult because you had to
 have knowledge on the command line, needed to edit text files to edit
 your packagesâ€™ store details and had to paste screenshots in a
 special system of directories to have them served well inside the
 F-Droid app.
 .
 This all got easier now: with Repomaker, you are able to create your
 own repo and do not need to have any special knowledge to do so.
